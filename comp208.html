						<h2>COMP 208</h2>
						<p>Computers in Engineering </p>
					</header>
					<p>My name is Ralph Bou Samra! I'm a McGill Software Engineering graduate student currently working as a Software Engineer at Uber Headquarters in San Francisco. I was a Teaching Assistant for Comp 208 for the past 2 years. When I joined McGill, I started as a civil engineering student who like most of you was not exposed to programming much. Being in that position, I understand the difficulties one encounters in his or her learning process of a "foreign" concept.

					As for my experience, I worked closely with Professor Friedman to prepare the exams for the course(Midterms and Finals). I was giving weekly tutorials during those 2 years. I know the course in and out and after last year's success feedback from students who attended my session, I decided to organize another prep session to help you crack your exam!</p>
