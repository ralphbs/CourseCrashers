						<h2>COMP 202</h2>

					<p>My name is Ralph! I'm a McGill Software Engineering graduate student currently working as a Software Engineer at Uber Headquarters in San Francisco. I was a Teaching Assistant for Comp 208 for the past 2 years. When I joined McGill, I started as a civil engineering student who like most of you was not exposed to programming much. Being in that position, I understand the difficulties one encounters in his or her learning process of a "foreign" concept.
